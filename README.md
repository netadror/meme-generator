### Meme generator
https://netadror.github.io/meme-generator/

A simple API-based meme generator, built from scratch with React, based on [Bob Ziroll's React Course on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend/). Made my own additions: added a capability to save and download the meme generated using htmlToImage and download.js.

### ⚒️ Built with:
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- JavaScript
- React
- htmlToImage
- download.js
